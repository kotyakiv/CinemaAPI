# CinemaAPI
Assignment project for Fatman Oy 

The project is done with <b>ASP.NET Core Web API</b>

#### <b>!!! Before running this API, create a test project for Unit test, copy the content and delete the folder UnitTests !!!</b>

#### Goal:
to implement API that should allow users to create, read, update, and delete records in a database using HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)


#### Required packages for the project:
1. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory
2. (Optional) NuGet\Install-Package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design -Version 6.0.11 

#### The API isn't pubished or hosted. Use Swagger to test and run the project
